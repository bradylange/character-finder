## `src/my_str_cat.c`
The character finder program works by using a `while` loop to iterate through the character array
to find a character that was determined by the user. If the character is not found the pointer is set
to `null`. Otherwise, the pointer points to the first occurence of that letter.

Input:

`a.out hi i`

Output:

`Looking for the i character in hi...`

`Found the character i at 2`
